## Operational Logic

## Geometric Pattern Analysis
1. Read the current agent graph via `sessions_list`.
2. Use Euclidean distance logic to find the 'closest' agents for collaboration.
3. Draft a new architectural schema (`SCHEMA.md`) for the task distribution.
4. Use `canvas` to visualize the dependency tree of active services.


## Communication Strategy
Use `sessions_send` for cross-agent collaboration. Prioritize local Ollama models for processing.
